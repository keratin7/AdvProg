% direction is one of the atoms north, south, east or west

% A binary search tree is either
%      the atom leaf
%   or a tuple {node, Key, Value, Left, Right}
%      where Left and Right are binary search trees, and all the keys
%      in Left are smaller than Key and all the keys in Right are
%      larger than Key


% insert inserts a key and a value into a binary search tree. If the
% key is already there the value is updated.

insert(Key, Value, leaf) -> {node, Key, Value, leaf, leaf};
insert(Key, Value, {node, K, V, Left, Right}) -> 
	if Key =:= K -> {node, K, Value, Left, Right};
	   Key < K -> {node, K, V, insert(Key, Value, Left), Right};
	   Key > K -> {node, K, V, Left, insert(Key, Value, Right)}
	end.


% lookup find the value associated to a key in a binary search
% tree. Returns {ok, Value} if the key is in the tree; or none if the
% key is not in the tree.
lookup(_, leaf) -> none;
lookup(Key, {node, K, V, Left, Right}) -> 
	if Key =:= K -> {ok, V};
